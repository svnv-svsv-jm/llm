  question: "Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is increasingly used to cope with the open-world assumption in service-oriented systems. Is this true?"
  answer-wo-rag: "No, Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is not necessarily increasing in use to cope with the open-world assumption in service-oriented systems. While Deep RL can be a powerful tool for learning and decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments, it may not be the best approach for all types of service-oriented systems. The open-world assumption refers to situations where new, unseen events or inputs can occur, which requires the system to adapt and learn on the fly. However, the specific requirements and constraints of each service-oriented system will determine whether Deep RL is the most appropriate solution. Therefore, while Deep RL has shown promise in some applications, its usage in service-oriented systems should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."
  answer-w-rag: "Yes, according to the provided context, Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is increasingly being used to address the open-world assumption in service-oriented systems. This information is mentioned in the abstract and also referenced in the section discussing related work. The authors note that Deep RL has been successfully applied to problems such as dynamic service composition, job scheduling, and offloading, as well as service adaptation, which further supports the claim that Deep RL is gaining popularity in this context."

Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is increasingly used to cope with the open-world assumption in service-oriented systems. Deep RL was successfully applied to problems such as dynamic service composition, job scheduling, and offloading, as well as service adaptation. While Deep RL offers many benefits, understanding the decision-making of Deep RL is challenging because its learned decision-making policy es- sentially appears as a black box. Yet, understanding the decision-making of Deep RL is', metadata={'source':'res/documents/2309.14391.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used to cope with the open-world assumption of service-oriented systems, as it helps to address the design-time un- certainty during service and systems engineering [1, 26].
